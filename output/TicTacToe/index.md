# Tutorial: TicTacToe

This project is a simple, web-based *Tic Tac Toe game*. Players **take turns** placing their 'X' or 'O' marks on a **grid of squares**. The game **checks** after each move to see if any player has achieved a **winning line** (three marks in a row, column, or diagonally), and it can be **reset** to start a new game.
